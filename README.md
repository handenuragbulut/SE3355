I used github to distribute my project
The basic content of the website is located in the index.html file.
Javascript, CSS, and HTML files are included in the project.
I used the mocky.io website to develop the API. There are ten city and ten course type.
When we enter the training content correctly, the "submit.html" page is the page we can be directed to.
I redirected the Categories, Contact, About pages, but it just clicks and goes to a blank page.
All of the webpage styling is included in style.css. It contains the responsive website code.
app.js contains the e-mail and phone number validations, the phone number must be the turkish number. There are Mocky links for city and course types in the app.js file.
